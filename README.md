Motown was a widely cherished label that has produced a lot of hits in the sixties and seventies. Even in the eighties Motown released a few hits like "Hello" by Lionel Richie or "I just called to say I love you" by Stevie Wonder. After Motown appointed new CEO Jheryl Busby in 1989, the label wasn't able to produce many more hits. The four hits from motown in the nineties were by Boys II Men. In the nineties, Motown would be sold and resold to many different labels, such as Polydor. Motown still had a rough time producing hits, but Motown kept releasing albums. A good example of a failed album released by motown is "Dirty South" by Rasheeda. Even though the single Do it made it far, the debut album by Rasheeda was recieved poorly and she was let go by Motown. During this project the difference between the hits Motown released in the 1900's and the albums that Motown released in the 2000's will be examined. To make a meaningfull comparison, a corpus has been created which contains the hits that Motown released and a couple of the albums Motown released in the 2000's, such as "Dirty South" by Rasheeda and "The people vs." by Tick Tick. The corpus consists of 128 songs. The most probable difference between Motown's 1900's and 2000's is the difference in genre. While Motown released a lot of 'westernized' soul and jazz tracks in the sixties through eighties, Motown switched to a more R&B approach by contracting boys to men in the nineties. These genres and their corresponding artists will therefore be examined during this project.

The first image, motown_plot1.png, shows the energy, acousticness and popularity of the tracks. The tracks have been divided into two classes, namely from_motown and not from_motown. This class describes wether a class is produced by Motown or not. It is interesting to see that the tracks both by and not by Motown are slightly clustered. This means that we cannot draw a conclusion to what made Motown so popular yet. Furthermore the image shows that acousticness and energy show a negative corelation. The less acoustic a track gets, the more energy a track contains
